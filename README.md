<h1>Hello There !</h1>
<p>My name is Santhosh Kumar, and I attend <a href=""> Nehru Arts And Science College.</a>
    I built the website PiracyForEverything, which provides the sources for everything available on the internet (ex :
    games,movies,anime,etc..)
    As a result, this page gives links to websites/resources that are difficult to find.
    I gathered those resources on Reddit's r/piracy megathread.
    Share this with your friends,family,teachers and students because this website will be useful for literally
    everyone,
    including those who work in various fields, students, instructors, artists, and, hopefully, everyone in the world.
